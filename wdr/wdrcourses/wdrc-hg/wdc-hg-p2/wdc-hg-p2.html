        <h3 class="">The Three Roads To Front End Web Development</h3>
        <p class="">
          The trifecta that is web development now are the giants HTML, CSS and
          js. HTML Stands for Hypertext Markup Language, CSS stands for
          Cascading Stylesheet and js stands for Javascript. I'm going to be
          telling you the roadmap which will take you months to do. First will
          be HTML. HTML is used to make web pages and web applications.
          Alongside, HTML you would like to make it look nice and pretty so you
          would need CSS in order to style it. Then Javascript to provide
          functionality and logic to you web applications. For now we are going
          to be learning HTML, CSS and then Javascript in order. If you like to
          learn CSS and Javascript both at the same time you are more then
          welcome but it is required that you know HTML. This series should be
          fast and only time and hard work will make you a good programmer.
        </p>
        <b> <p>Good Luck.</p></b>
        <p>
          In basic HTML you are able to put text, tables, lists, images, videos
          and much more into your webpage. This is what is meant by presentation
          text in a predefined manner. The markup langauge is suppose to layout
          your web page. It is said hyptext in html stands for linking to other
          webpages hence the hypterext markup language. Of course, html is not a
          programming language, so it requires not as much logic as an actual
          programming language keep that in mind it is only for layout and
          “potential” style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just five years ago, the launch of html5 came about but I can tell you
          that so far, it's not that much different but a few changes. I will go
          over what important topics you will need in this series. Also, you can
          think of html5 as an updated version.
